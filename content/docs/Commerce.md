# Sitecore Commerce support

Sifon supports Sitecore Commerce of version 9.x and 10.x (XC). While performing backups and restore  Sifon also suggests processing XC assets and distinguish  them from each other on multi-instance installations.

**Please note:** that has been successfully tested on the default XC installations of various versions and may not functions well on highly customized Commerce powered solutions. Please you a [feedback](/ "feedback") link in order advise me on such cases so that I could resolve Sifon work these issues out in the future versions.
