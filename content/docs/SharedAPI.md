# Shared API

Shared API is a set of reusable GUI controls available for your custom plugins scripts that are profile agnostic and will work for both local and remote profiles.

These controls are located at **Sifon.Shared.dll** library.

## Existing controls

Currently the following controls are available:

- [Folder Browser](/content/docs/SharedAPI/FolderBrowser.md "Folder Browser")
- [Index Selector](/content/docs/SharedAPI/IndexSelector.md "Index Selector")
- [Local File Picker](/content/docs/SharedAPI/LocalFilePicker.md "Local File Picker")
- [Package Version Selector](/content/docs/SharedAPI/PackageVersionSelector.md "Package Version Selector")
- [Sitecore Version Selector](/content/docs/SharedAPI/SitecoreVersionSelector.md "Sitecore Version Selector")

## Usage examples

It is obvious that the best understanding comes from testing in action. You may find usage examples for every single control either at [Labs & Demo](/content/docs/Labs.md "Labs & Demo") section or performing a search by content from existing plugins from the public plugins library.
